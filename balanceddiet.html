        <h1>Eating a balanced diet</h1>
        <h4>Eating a healthy, balanced diet is an important part of maintaining good health, and can help you feel your best.</h4>
        <p>This means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. <br>

            This page covers healthy eating advice for the general population. <br>
            
            People with special dietary needs or a medical condition should ask their doctor or a registered dietitian for advice.</p>

            <h3>Food groups in your diet</h3>
            <p>The Eatwell Guide shows that to have a healthy, balanced diet, people should try to: <br> <br>
            (a). eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day <br>

            (b). base meals on higher fibre starchy foods like potatoes, bread, rice or pasta <br>
            (c). have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks) <br>
            (d). eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other protein <br>
            (e). choose unsaturated oils and spreads, and eat them in small amounts <br>
            (f). drink plenty of fluids (at least 6 to 8 glasses a day)</p> <br>
            
            <p>If you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt and sugar, have these less often and in small amounts. <br> <br>

                Try to choose a variety of different foods from the 5 main food groups to get a wide range of nutrients. <br> <br>
                
                Most people in the UK eat and drink too many calories, too much saturated fat, sugar and salt, and not enough fruit, vegetables, oily fish or fibre. <br> <br>
                
                The Eatwell Guide does not apply to children under the age of 2 because they have different nutritional needs. <br> <br>
                
                Between the ages of 2 and 5 years, children should gradually move to eating the same foods as the rest of the family in the proportions shown in the Eatwell Guide.</p>
