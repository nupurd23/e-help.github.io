        <h3>Getting healthy</h3>
        <p>‘Healthy living’ means maintaining a healthy lifestyle and introducing habits that improve your health. It can be difficult to change old habits, but there are steps you can take to become healthier. An important first step is identifying less healthy habits and learning new, positive ones to replace them, such as:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>eating healthy foods and balanced meals</li>
            <li>sleeping well and managing stress</li>
            <li>practicing safe sex, drinking alcohol responsibly and not abusing drugs</li>
            <li>being aware of any health risks related to your illness and its treatment, and working with your doctor to monitor these and then take action</li>
            <li>taking responsibility for your overall health including having regular check-ups for your eyes and teeth.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>HOW TO DEVELOP POSITIVE HEALTH HABITS</h3>
        <h4>Work around challenges</h4>
        <p>There are things you can do to manage any extra challenges related to your illness and it’s treatment – such as drowsiness, sugar cravings or lack of motivation. Steps you can take include:
            <ul><li>organise daily activities around side-effects of medication, for example, if you are drowsy in the morning, organise exercise for the afternoon.</li>
            <li>discuss things with your doctor – there may be another medication you can try, or ask for referral to a specialist such as a dietitian or psychologist for expert advice.</li>
            </ul>
