        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, the epidemiological control of most viral infections depends on the isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, personal protection by infection control measures, and mass vaccination, because specific antiviral treatment is generally not available for most viral infections . This scenario is rapidly changing with the increasing availability of rapid diagnostic tests that use nucleic acid amplification and the development of increasing number of effective antiviral agents. Common acute viral diseases such as respiratory, diarrheal, exanthematous, or neurological infections can overlap with each other and appear as seasonal epidemics that peak in incidence every few years and coincide with the accumulation of sufficient number of nonimmune hosts in the young population. Arboviral disease activity often coincides with arthropod vector activity such as mosquito breeding in hot rainy seasons that are associated with increased incidence of hemorrhagic fever or neurological diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, West Nile virus, or Japanese encephalitis in Southeast Asia. Many chronic blood-borne viral illnesses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are still taking a major toll in certain geographic regions due to specific human behaviors or vertical transmission. Some of these chronic viral infections such as HBV, HCV, HIV, polyomaviruses, and papillomaviruses are also linked to the genesis of cancers. Over 70% of emerging viral infections such as the Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are associated with acute explosive outbreaks after the virus jumps the species barrier from bats or other animals to human . This chapter will focus on the prevention and control of viral infections, while other article in this book will cover information on specific viruses.

        <h3>Diagnostic Approaches for Viral Illness</h3>
        <p>Unlike bacteria, fungi, and parasites, viruses are too small to be visible under light microscopy. Moreover, viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens and do not grow in artificial culture medium. Collecting the correct clinical specimens during the peak of viral shedding in appropriate viral transport medium is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Electron microscopy is not sensitive and has a limited role in the examination of feces from viral gastroenteritis and vesicular fluid from skin lesions caused by herpesviruses and poxviruses. Virus isolation in cell lines or chick embryo is the gold standard for virological diagnosis but seldom alters clinical management due to its long turnaround time. Viral antigen detection by immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay, and point-of-care rapid lateral flow immunochromatographic assays has significant impact on therapeutic and infection control strategies.

            The most important rapid virological tests are nucleic acid amplification tests such as real-time or multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays that are useful for accurate diagnosis and subsequent viral load monitoring during antiviral treatment. Genotyping by nucleic acid amplification and sequencing for detection of mutations associated with antiviral resistance directly from clinical specimens is now available for many antiviral agents and is routine for antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection. Though nucleic acid amplification tests still have practical limitations in the field settings of developing areas, such tests are now routine in most hospitals in developed countries. Antibody testing by enzyme immunoassay for IgM in acute infection, IgG for immune status of exposed individuals, and retrospective diagnosis by the presence of rising antibody titers in paired acute and convalescent sera of symptomatic patients is useful for making clinical and epidemiological decisions. Antibody screening is especially important in antenatal visits of expectant mothers, blood donors, and organ donor and recipients before transplantation. Next-generation sequencing performed directly on clinical specimens may revolutionize virological diagnosis in the coming decade. The timely and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has important implications for effective epidemiological control in the community and infection control for hospital outbreaks.</p>

            <h3>Viral Transmission and Infection Control Prevention for Blood-Borne Viruses Including HIV, HBV, and HCV</h3>
            <p>Transmission of blood-borne viruses can result from sexual intercourse and maternal–fetal transmission in the community setting and needlestick injury and other exposure-prone procedures in the healthcare setting. In a study from the United States, the annual death rate of healthcare workers from occupational events was estimated to be 17–57 per 1 million workers, and most of these deaths resulted from infection-related complications of blood-borne viruses (Sepkowitz and Eisenberg, 2005). The overall risk of transmission of blood-borne viruses by hollow needlestick injury is 33%, 3%, and 0.3% if the source is a hepatitis carrier with positive HBe antigen or high viral load, hepatitis C carrier with RNAaemia, and HIV, respectively. Compliance with standard precautions including wearing gloves when handling blood during patient care practice, disposing sharp and needles into puncture-resistant box, and avoidance of recapping needles remains the most important way to prevent nosocomial acquisition of blood-borne viruses (Garner, 1996). <br>

                Active immunization for HBV can protect healthcare workers from HBV infection with an efficacy of 80–95% (Dienstag et al., 1984, Sabido et al., 2007, Shim et al., 2011). Postimmunization anti-HBs antibody level should be measured at 4–8 weeks after completion of the 3-dose immunization regimen given at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months. A good responder is defined as a person whose anti-HBs antibody level is > 100 IU l− 1. If the hepatitis B antibody level is between 10 and 100 IU l− 1, a booster dose of vaccine should be given. For nonresponders whose anti-HBs antibody is < 10 IU l− 1, another course of HBV vaccine should be given. The response rate is about 61% in repeated HBV vaccination by the same route as the initial vaccination (Struve et al., 1994). Alternatively, immunization with high-dose intradermal recombinant HBV vaccine, given in up to four doses, can achieve immunity in 88% of healthcare workers who failed to respond to intramuscular vaccination and boosters (Levitz et al., 1995). The anti-HBs titer was persistently higher than the protective level for at least 10 years after primary HBV vaccination (Floreani et al., 2004). <br>
                
                When a healthcare worker sustains a needlestick injury, he or she should be advised to rinse the wound with tap water and allow natural bleeding. The source patient's blood is collected to check for the presence of HIV, HBV, and HCV. If the status of blood-borne viruses of the source patient is positive or unknown, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be offered according to current guidelines (Kuhar et al., 2013). The exposed healthcare worker will be closely followed up for counseling, baseline, and HIV testing and monitored for drug toxicity. If a newer fourth-generation combination HIV p24 antigen–HIV antibody test is utilized for follow-up HIV testing, HIV testing may be concluded 4 months after exposure. Otherwise, follow-up HIV testing is performed 6 months after the exposure (Kuhar et al., 2013). For HBV, PEP with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and/or HBV vaccination should be considered for occupational exposures after evaluation of the HBsAg status of the source and the vaccination and vaccine-response status of the exposed person (2001). For HCV, PEP is not currently recommended. However, an open-label pilot trial was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and acceptance of peginterferon alfa-2b as PEP. Among 213 healthcare workers exposed to an HCV antibody-positive source, 51 HCWs enrolled in the study and 44 (86%) elected to undergo peginterferon alfa-2b as the study group. Seven subjects elected not to undergo PEP were treated as the control group. In this pilot study, peginterferon alfa-2b was proved to be safe without serious adverse side effects. However, the lack of HCV transmission in both the study and control groups did not support the routine use of PEP in healthcare workers after HCV exposure (Corey et al., 2009). It is likely that the new polymerase and protease inhibitors used in the treatment of HCV infection will result in new strategies for PEP of HCV exposures. <br>
                
                Blood-borne viruses can also be transmitted from healthcare workers to patients, especially during exposure-prone procedures in dental and cardiothoracic operations. The most well-known example involved an HIV-positive dentist working in Florida, the United States, who infected five of his patients after performing invasive dental procedures on them (Ciesielski et al., 1992). Sequencing of the HIV proviral envelope gene showed that the viruses infecting the dentist and the five patients were closely related (Ou et al., 1992). However, the overall risk for transmission of HIV from a healthcare worker to a patient is very small. In a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of 22 171 patients being cared by 51 HIV-positive healthcare workers, 113 (0.5%) patients became HIV-positive. Epidemiological investigation did not implicate healthcare workers as the source of infection in any of these patients (Robert et al., 1995). In contrast, transmission of HBV and HCV from healthcare workers to patients was more frequently documented. Between August 1991 and July 1992, 19 of 144 (13%) patients who were operated on by a thoracic surgeon with acute HBV infection became HBV-infected. Sequencing of 160 bases in the core region of HBV showed an indistinguishable pattern among the strains of the surgeon and nine infected patients (Harpaz et al., 1996). Subsequently, numerous healthcare worker-to-patient transmissions of HBV and HCV were reported. Among all these reported cases, the viral loads of the index healthcare workers were more than 106 genome copies per milliliter (Buster et al., 2003, Gunson et al., 2003). In this connection, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) issued a guideline for the management of healthcare workers who are infected with HIV, HBV, and HCV to impose restriction on different categories of exposure-prone procedures according to the viral load (Henderson et al., 2010).</p>
