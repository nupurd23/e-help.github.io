        <p>Traditionally, the epidemiological control of most viral infections depends on the isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, personal protection by infection control measures, and mass vaccination, because specific antiviral treatment is generally not available for most viral infections . This scenario is rapidly changing with the increasing availability of rapid diagnostic tests that use nucleic acid amplification and the development of increasing number of effective antiviral agents. Common acute viral diseases such as respiratory, diarrheal, exanthematous, or neurological infections can overlap with each other and appear as seasonal epidemics that peak in incidence every few years and coincide with the accumulation of sufficient number of nonimmune hosts in the young population. Arboviral disease activity often coincides with arthropod vector activity such as mosquito breeding in hot rainy seasons that are associated with increased incidence of hemorrhagic fever or neurological diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, West Nile virus, or Japanese encephalitis in Southeast Asia. Many chronic blood-borne viral illnesses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are still taking a major toll in certain geographic regions due to specific human behaviors or vertical transmission. Some of these chronic viral infections such as HBV, HCV, HIV, polyomaviruses, and papillomaviruses are also linked to the genesis of cancers. Over 70% of emerging viral infections such as the Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are associated with acute explosive outbreaks after the virus jumps the species barrier from bats or other animals to human . This chapter will focus on the prevention and control of viral infections, while other article in this book will cover information on specific viruses.

        <p>Unlike bacteria, fungi, and parasites, viruses are too small to be visible under light microscopy. Moreover, viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens and do not grow in artificial culture medium. Collecting the correct clinical specimens during the peak of viral shedding in appropriate viral transport medium is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Electron microscopy is not sensitive and has a limited role in the examination of feces from viral gastroenteritis and vesicular fluid from skin lesions caused by herpesviruses and poxviruses. Virus isolation in cell lines or chick embryo is the gold standard for virological diagnosis but seldom alters clinical management due to its long turnaround time. Viral antigen detection by immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay, and point-of-care rapid lateral flow immunochromatographic assays has significant impact on therapeutic and infection control strategies. <br>

            The most important rapid virological tests are nucleic acid amplification tests such as real-time or multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays that are useful for accurate diagnosis and subsequent viral load monitoring during antiviral treatment. Genotyping by nucleic acid amplification and sequencing for detection of mutations associated with antiviral resistance directly from clinical specimens is now available for many antiviral agents and is routine for antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection. Though nucleic acid amplification tests still have practical limitations in the field settings of developing areas, such tests are now routine in most hospitals in developed countries. Antibody testing by enzyme immunoassay for IgM in acute infection, IgG for immune status of exposed individuals, and retrospective diagnosis by the presence of rising antibody titers in paired acute and convalescent sera of symptomatic patients is useful for making clinical and epidemiological decisions. Antibody screening is especially important in antenatal visits of expectant mothers, blood donors, and organ donor and recipients before transplantation. Next-generation sequencing performed directly on clinical specimens may revolutionize virological diagnosis in the coming decade. The timely and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has important implications for effective epidemiological control in the community and infection control for hospital outbreaks.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Transmission of blood-borne viruses can result from sexual intercourse and maternal–fetal transmission in the community setting and needlestick injury and other exposure-prone procedures in the healthcare setting. In a study from the United States, the annual death rate of healthcare workers from occupational events was estimated to be 17–57 per 1 million workers, and most of these deaths resulted from infection-related complications of blood-borne viruses (Sepkowitz and Eisenberg, 2005). The overall risk of transmission of blood-borne viruses by hollow needlestick injury is 33%, 3%, and 0.3% if the source is a hepatitis carrier with positive HBe antigen or high viral load, hepatitis C carrier with RNAaemia, and HIV, respectively. Compliance with standard precautions including wearing gloves when handling blood during patient care practice, disposing sharp and needles into puncture-resistant box, and avoidance of recapping needles remains the most important way to prevent nosocomial acquisition of blood-borne viruses (Garner, 1996). <br>
